            the fortnite storyline is that you are in a loop contained by the zero point this season the zero point is free so we are all free right? no the foundation and jones went on a mission to defeat geno in this live event (geno is the leader of the io which is a evil organization) but before the zero point was stabilized the imagined and geno were fighting but it was obviously a clone so do you wanna know what happens if  you enter the zero point without stabilizing it all your cells GO TO OTHER UNIVIRSES crazy well thats all i know see ya :)
